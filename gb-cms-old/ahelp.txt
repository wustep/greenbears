Editting
* Use ctrl + right click to access the browser context menu, allowing pasting as plain text and spellcheck corrections (if your browser supports them). 
* All external links automatically open in a new tab.
* It's possible to copy paste from Excel. However, the formatting doesn't stay. One odd workaround is to copy paste from Excel into Word, then copy paste it from there.
* Use Shift+Enter to add a new line without extra space.

Referencing
* Uploading, linking, and referencing files in the server can be done in the Image and Link interfaces. Press the "Browse Server" button.
** To link to an internal page (like a news page), set the Protocol to "Other" and then type in the page after the slash, e.g. "news?title=test". 
* To add youtube videos or other "iframes", copy the embed code (for youtube, it's under share), then press the source button in the editor, and then paste the code where desired.

Misc
* Mobile/tablet support is pretty much hit and miss. If the editor isn't showing up, try requesting the desktop site on your browser.

* Note that this is a evaluation version, as is CKEditor; it prevents moving files, but both give all the necesary features. 
* Mobiles and other devices are supported. Click the black triangle to access the file context menu.
