# greenbears-cms
Sports content management system - manage news, seasons, records, contact - supports multiple seasons &amp; sports

# /old/
CMS only supports two sports (cross country, track & field) and limited features, requires setup time
- note: backups, password resets, season management are done manually through SQL (instructions to come)
- note: user creation instructions to come
- development began in March 2013, launched August 2013
- http://greenbears.us: used for the Ottawa Hills HS cross-country ('13, '14) and track & field ('14, '15) seasons
- after adding in multiple-sport support, this project will be completed

# /new/
A migration to WordPress is underway!
- more flexible, secure, and efficient, uses Posts for news and Pages for Schedule/Records/Contact/etc. 
- categories may eventually serve as seasons; tags are unused
