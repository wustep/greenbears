# greenbears
Sports content management system - manage news, seasons, records, contact - supports multiple seasons &amp; sports

# upcoming
A migration to WordPress or something else is underway!
- more flexible, secure, and efficient, uses Posts for news and Pages for Schedule/Records/Contact/etc. 
- categories may eventually serve as seasons; tags are unused

# /gbcms/
CMS only supports two sports (cross country, track & field) and limited features, requires setup time
http://greenbears.us: used for the Ottawa Hills HS cross-country ('13, '14) and track & field ('14, '15) seasons
- note: backups, password resets, season management are done manually through SQL (instructions to come)
- development began in March 2013, launched August 2013
- after adding in multiple-sport support, this project will be completed

# why 'Greenbears'?
Green bears were my HS mascot and where this all started!
